- 👋 Hi, I’m @rrevi
- 👀 I’m interested in modern Web app development. The full stack. I find joy in piecing together a solution that is both functional and performant.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Crystal, WebAssembly, Helidon, and Preact
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping Crystal and related ecosystem become more mainstream. Also, I am always happy to help OSS, at the very least by testing it (it's my way of giving my 2 cents back to the community).
- 📫 You can reach me at rafael.e.revi@gmail.com
