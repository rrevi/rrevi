### About
- Hi, I’m @rrevi
- I'm a Principal Applications Engineer at [@oracle](https://github.com/oracle)

### Interests
- Full-stack Web appplication development
- Front-end: Preact, though I prefer server-side rendering (e.g. [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/))
- Back-end: Ruby on Rails, Helidon
- Languages: (modern) Java, Ruby
- Virtualization: WebAssembly
- Shell: Fish, Nushell
- Concurrency: I have an obsession with performance by using all CPU cores (when possible), e.g. [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#how-is-it-so-fast), [Parallel Testing in Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#parallel-testing), [Nushell Parallelism support](https://www.nushell.sh/book/parallelism.html), etc.
- Learning: Crystal, Rust, TruffleRuby (and the GraalVM)
